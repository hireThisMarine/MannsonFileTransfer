===================

Over the years I keep referencing an assignment that I had for a network programming assignment in the summer of 2010.  My partner was a guy named Maximilian Manndorf (cool name, no?) and we wrote a functional program but not very graceful.  This is me attempting to polish the code and transition it to a singleton architecture.
